MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network

Here we are working with MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network
This is an image recognization task. 
We have a dataset of about 70,000 handwritten numbers. We will feed this data to our Deep Learning Model and try to predict the numbers. 

The numbers are all in different shapes and styles. 
There will be lots of converting the data into simple numbers so that it's easy for our model to understand and process it faster. 

Now once we are done we will give new image and let our model predict the number that it in the new image.
